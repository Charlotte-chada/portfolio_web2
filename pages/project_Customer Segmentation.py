st.write("This project aims to classify customers into groups based on the provided data. A single CSV file of customer information, containing customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score, is imported and analysed. The dataset underwent processing stages including data loading, data cleaning, data exploration, data encoding, and data clustering using K-means and DBSCAN models with dimensionality reduction techniques. Finally, model evaluation was performed. The insights from the data analysis and the results of the two clustering models will be presented and explained in the report.")
