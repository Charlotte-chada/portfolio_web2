st.write("This project utilises the IMDB dataset, containing single-sentence reviews collected from three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com. The dataset underwent several processing stages, including data preparation, data exploration, feature engineering, hyperparameter fine-tuning, data modelling, and evaluation. The goal of the sentiment model is to classify whether the review is positive or not. The report of this project will discuss insights from the data analysis, and the results of the classification model will be addressed and explained")
